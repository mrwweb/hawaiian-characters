== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Is this plugin compatible with WordPress 5.0 / "Gutenberg"? =

Yes! This plugin supports the [Insert Special Characters plugin](https://wordpress.org/plugins/insert-special-characters/) for WordPress 5.0. Install that plugin alongside this one to use a similar Character Map feature as the old WordPress. Thanks to 10up for building that plugin!

The old Character Map function remains available in WordPress 5.0 in two ways:

1. On any page using the "Classic Editor" (pre-WordPress 5.0), most likely via the [Classic Editor plugin](https://wordpress.org/plugins/classic-editor/).
1. Via the "Classic" block of the new editor. (See the third screenshot.)

== Installation ==

1. Go to `Plugins > Add New` in your WordPress Dashboard
1. Search for "Hawaiian Characters"
1. Click "Install" for the Hawaiian Characters plugin (first result)
1. Click the "Activate Plugin" link
1. If using WordPress 5.0+, repeat these steps 2-4 for the plugin "Insert Special Characters"
